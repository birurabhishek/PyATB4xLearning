Decorators
----------
* Decorators in python are a way to modify the behaviour of a function or class without changing its source code
* They are powerful tool that also to wrap another function and extends its functionality,
  while keeping original functional code unchanged.

Benefits of using decorators
----------------------------

1. Code Reusability: Allows to reuse the same functionality across multiple functions without duplicating code.
2. Separation of concerns : Separating the core logic of function from auxiliary concerns like logging, access, control etc.
3. Enhanced Readability : Can make you code more readable and maintainable by clearly separating different aspects of functionality.

Different types of decorator
----------------------------
1. @staticmethod
2. @classmethod
3. @property
4. @functools.wrap

These we will use in OOPS method

Two decorators can be used known as chaining of decorators
